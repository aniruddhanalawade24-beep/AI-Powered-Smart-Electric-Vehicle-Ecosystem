# ðŸš—ðŸ”‹ AI-Powered Smart Electric Vehicle Ecosystem

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Develop an **AI-Powered Smart Electric Vehicle Ecosystem** using **Neural Networks** for:
- âš¡ Integrated Charging Infrastructure Optimization  
- ðŸ”‹ Battery Lifecycle Management  
- ðŸ”„ Bidirectional Grid Energy Management  

The goal is to **maximize system efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance grid stability**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** that connects 3 critical parts of EV ecosystem:

1. **Charging Demand Forecasting**  
   - Predict EV charging demand using past consumption data.  
   - Helps optimize charging station loads.  

2. **Battery Lifecycle Management**  
   - Predict **battery health (SoH)** and **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)**.  
   - Estimate how capacity degrades over chargeâ€“discharge cycles.  

3. **Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Optimization**  
   - Decide when EVs should **charge** (cheap electricity, solar available) or **discharge** (high electricity price).  
   - Stabilizes the grid and reduces charging cost.
